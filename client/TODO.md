# TODO

- Make extra un-deletable cards for padding in the scroller so it doesn't crash
- Make add task function reflect in database after adding to UI
- Make add button more visible
- Fix styling scoping so that CSS leaks don't occur
- auto assign IDs to task elements (task ID's should be stored in mongo database too(?))
- fix delay animation (so cooked right now)
- Create form fields and link submit data to function return
- Go through main .jsx files and look for onclick={function()} and replace with onClick={function}
- Fix colors on filtermenu to actually good looking colors
- unify styling along the whole website and apps
- migrate app code to react native -> re-enable iOS button and download potential
- add login with guest feature (local only, no database)
