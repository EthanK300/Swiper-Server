# TODO

- auto assign IDs to task elements (task ID's should be stored in mongo database too(?))
- fix delay animation (so cooked right now)
- Create form/ui elements for the add task via web
- Edit navbar so that the about element checks for on home page if not navigates there first
- Go through main .jsx files and look for onclick={function()} and replace with onClick={function}
- Fix colors on filtermenu to actually good looking colors
- unify styling along the whole website and apps
- figure out pivot to react native for mobile
